# Python test

This test is designed to help us assess your level of knowledge in the areas of Python, APIs and UI.
It's based on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Technologies to be used

- Python incl. all available libraries and frameworks
- JavaScript incl. all available libraries and frameworks
- HTML
- CSS/SASS/SCSS

## Task

- Create a fork of this repository
- Run the FastAPI development server (`uvicorn main:app --reload`) and access http://localhost:8000/
- Use a sans-serif font family for the template
- Align the boxes, so that they are in the right order
- Add some space between the boxes and try to center the whole thing
- There's an API available in this project. Do you know where to find it?
- Are you able to consume it in the template (using JavaScript) to use its response data to render the boxes?

## Requirements

- You have 45 minutes to do this
- Use the already created FastAPI project

## Notes

- There is no sample solution here
- First and foremost, functionality, clean code and speed are important
